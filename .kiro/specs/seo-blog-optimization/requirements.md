# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive SEO optimization strategy for Your Clean Queen cleaning services website to dominate the Dorchester cleaning market and outrank key competitors Lucy's Cleaning Services and Maid2Clean. Based on competitive analysis and current SEO data showing excellent impressions (320+ for "cleaners dorchester", 112+ for "dorchester cleaning services") but poor click-through rates (mostly 0% CTR), this system will exploit competitor weaknesses and establish market dominance through:

## **Competitive Landscape Analysis:**
- **Lucy's Cleaning Services**: Strong local presence but NO BLOG, weak meta optimization, generic positioning
- **Maid2Clean**: Excellent reviews/trust but NO CONTENT MARKETING, price-focused competition (£17.48/hour), corporate franchise feel
- **Market Gap**: ZERO cleaning companies in Dorchester have blogs or content marketing strategies

## **Our Competitive Advantages Strategy:**

1. **Content Domination** - Be the ONLY cleaning company in Dorchester with a comprehensive blog
2. **Premium Positioning** - "Royal Treatment" vs competitors' generic/budget positioning  
3. **Meta Optimization Superiority** - Compelling titles vs competitors' boring "Company Name + Location" format
4. **Service Specialization** - Target missed opportunities like end of tenancy cleaning
5. **Local Authority Building** - Comprehensive area coverage (Poundbury, Weymouth, West Dorset)
6. **Enhanced User Experience** - Rich snippets, schema, and conversion optimization

The strategy focuses on capturing the content marketing vacuum left by competitors while establishing premium brand positioning that justifies higher prices than Maid2Clean's £17.48/hour race-to-the-bottom approach.
