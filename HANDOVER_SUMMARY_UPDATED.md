**Date:** May 28, 2025
**Project:** Your Clean Queen Website Redesign - Phase 1 & Initial Phase 2 Implementation
**Handover From:** AI Development Assistant (Roo)
**Handover To:** Next Development Team

## 1. Executive Summary

This document summarizes the development work undertaken to redesign the "Your Clean Queen" website. The primary goal was to align the site's layout and style with the "CleanMe" HTML template (provided in the `clean/` directory) while implementing the new brand strategy (new color palette, updated messaging) as outlined in the original `HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md`.

Significant progress has been made in restructuring key components, updating branding, and resolving critical build configuration issues related to Tailwind CSS.

## 2. Overview of Work Completed

### 2.1. Brand Implementation (Phase 1 - Complete)
*   **CSS Color Palette:** The global stylesheet ([`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css:1)) has been updated to reflect the new brand colors:
    *   Primary Vibrant Green: `#00D4AA`
    *   Secondary Sage Green: `#A8E6CF`
    *   Warm Gray (text): `#6B7280`
    *   Accent Cream (background): `#F9FAFB`
    *   Manual utility classes for these colors were updated/created in [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css:1) using the `@layer utilities` approach.
*   **Logo Integration:** The company logo ([`public/images/logo.jpeg`](public/images/logo.jpeg)) has been integrated into the [`Navbar.tsx`](src/components/Navbar.tsx:1) component.
*   **Content & Messaging Update:**
    *   Outdated messaging ("Regal Standards," "royal treatment") has been replaced across the site with the new primary messaging: "Professional cleaning with a personal touch."
    *   Prominence of "Founded by Teal" has been minimized.
    *   Affected components include: [`Hero.tsx`](src/components/Hero.tsx:1), [`About.tsx`](src/components/About.tsx:1), [`Footer.tsx`](src/components/Footer.tsx:1), [`BookingForm.tsx`](src/components/BookingForm.tsx:1), [`Testimonials.tsx`](src/components/Testimonials.tsx:1), and SEO metadata in [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx:1).

### 2.2. Layout Redesign (Alignment with "CleanMe" Template - In Progress)
The following components have been substantially refactored to match the structure and style of the "CleanMe" HTML template:
*   **[`Navbar.tsx`](src/components/Navbar.tsx:1):** Rebuilt to include a top bar (for contact info/social links) and a main navigation area, styled with the new brand colors. Uses Heroicons for some icons.
*   **[`Hero.tsx`](src/components/Hero.tsx:1):** Completely redesigned with a two-column layout (text content on the left, "Get A Quote" form on the right), featuring a background image with a gradient overlay, all styled with the new brand palette.
*   **[`Services.tsx`](src/components/Services.tsx:1):** Layout updated to a card-based grid (3 columns on large screens) as per the "CleanMe" service section, using placeholder images and new brand colors. Icons and detailed feature lists were removed from the cards for a simpler look matching the template.
*   **[`About.tsx`](src/components/About.tsx:1):** Restructured to a two-column layout (image on one side, descriptive text and CTA on the other).
*   **[`Feature.tsx`](src/components/Feature.tsx:1):** A new component created to house "Why Choose Us" points, mirroring the "CleanMe" template's "Feature" section (two-column layout: text block left, grid of feature items right). *Note: This component has been created but not yet added to the main page render in [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx:1).*

### 2.3. Build Configuration & Dependencies
*   **Tailwind CSS Version:**
    *   Identified that the project was inadvertently using Tailwind CSS v4, contrary to the handover document's specification of v3.
    *   Successfully downgraded `tailwindcss` to v3 (`^3.0.0`) in [`package.json`](package.json:1).
    *   Installed `@types/tailwindcss` for v3 TypeScript support.
*   **PostCSS Configuration:**
    *   Updated [`postcss.config.mjs`](postcss.config.mjs:1) to the standard v3 configuration: `plugins: { tailwindcss: {}, autoprefixer: {} }`.
*   **Module System:**
    *   Set `"type": "module"` in [`package.json`](package.json:1) to establish ES modules as the default for the project.
    *   To resolve a conflict where Tailwind's internals attempted to `require()` its config file as CommonJS (while `.js` files were being treated as ESM due to `"type": "module"`), `tailwind.config.ts` was renamed to [`tailwind.config.cjs`](tailwind.config.cjs:1) and its syntax updated to CommonJS (`module.exports`). This resolved the build errors.
*   **Next.js Component Warnings:**
    *   Addressed `legacyBehavior` warnings for `next/link` components in modified files ([`Navbar.tsx`](src/components/Navbar.tsx:1), [`Hero.tsx`](src/components/Hero.tsx:1), [`About.tsx`](src/components/About.tsx:1)).
    *   Addressed `layout` and `objectFit` legacy prop warnings for `next/image` components in modified files ([`Hero.tsx`](src/components/Hero.tsx:1), [`Services.tsx`](src/components/Services.tsx:1)), migrating to the `fill` prop and `object-cover` class / style property.
*   **Heroicons:** Installed `@heroicons/react` for use in the Navbar.

## 3. Current Project State
*   The Navbar, Hero, Services, and About sections are structurally and stylistically closer to the "CleanMe" template, incorporating the new brand identity.
*   The build system is stable with Tailwind CSS v3.
*   The [`tailwind.config.cjs`](tailwind.config.cjs:1) `theme.extend` section is currently minimal (empty `colors` and `fontFamily` objects). This was done to ensure the build passed during troubleshooting. It needs to be repopulated with the new brand's theme values to allow Tailwind to generate utility classes for them (e.g., `text-vibrant-green`).
*   The new [`Feature.tsx`](src/components/Feature.tsx:1) component is created but not yet integrated into [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx:1).

## 4. Next Steps & Recommendations for Next Developer

1.  **Populate `tailwind.config.cjs` Theme:**
    *   Add the new brand colors (e.g., `vibrant-green: '#00D4AA'`, `sage-green: '#A8E6CF'`, etc.) and `fontFamily` (Montserrat) to the `theme.extend` object in [`tailwind.config.cjs`](tailwind.config.cjs:1).
    *   This will enable Tailwind to generate utility classes for your brand palette, which can then be used throughout the components for better consistency and maintainability, potentially reducing reliance on purely manual utilities in [`globals.css`](src/app/globals.css:1).

2.  **Integrate `Feature.tsx`:**
    *   Import and add the newly created [`Feature.tsx`](src/components/Feature.tsx:1) component into the main page layout in [`src/app/page.tsx`](src/app/page.tsx:1) (e.g., after the "About" section).

3.  **Continue Rebuilding Sections (as per "CleanMe" template):**
    *   **Testimonials ([`Testimonials.tsx`](src/components/Testimonials.tsx:1)):** Refactor to match the carousel style shown in the "CleanMe" template. This might involve installing a carousel library (like Swiper.js or react-slick) or building a custom one with Tailwind.
    *   **Footer ([`Footer.tsx`](src/components/Footer.tsx:1)):** Rebuild to match the multi-column layout and style of the "CleanMe" footer.
    *   **New Sections (Optional, based on "CleanMe"):** Consider implementing other sections present in the "CleanMe" template if they align with "Your Clean Queen's" requirements:
        *   Team Section
        *   FAQs Section
        *   Pricing Plan Section
        *   Newsletter Signup
        *   Blog Excerpts
        *   Full-width Call to Action bar

4.  **Visual Polish & Refinements:**
    *   Conduct a thorough visual review of all updated sections across different screen sizes.
    *   Fine-tune spacing, typography, alignment, and hover/focus states for a cohesive and polished look.
    *   Ensure consistent application of brand colors.

5.  **Image Placeholders:**
    *   Replace all `https://placehold.co` image URLs with high-quality, professional photography relevant to the brand and services.

6.  **Form Functionality:**
    *   Implement backend logic or third-party service integration for the "Get A Quote" form in the Hero section and the main [`BookingForm.tsx`](src/components/BookingForm.tsx:1).

7.  **SEO Review:**
    *   While the original SEO metadata in `layout.tsx` was to be preserved, review all new text content and component structures for on-page SEO best practices.

8.  **Testing:**
    *   Perform comprehensive testing, including responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and functionality of interactive elements (forms, links, mobile menu).

## 5. Important Project-Specific Notes
*   **Tech Stack:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3. Key configuration files are [`tailwind.config.cjs`](tailwind.config.cjs:1), [`postcss.config.mjs`](postcss.config.mjs:1), and [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css:1).
*   **Module System:** The project is configured with `"type": "module"` in [`package.json`](package.json:1). Tailwind's configuration file is [`tailwind.config.cjs`](tailwind.config.cjs:1) to ensure compatibility.
*   **Inspiration Template:** The "CleanMe" HTML template (located in the `clean/` directory) serves as the primary structural and stylistic reference for this redesign.
*   **Initial Handover Document:** Refer to the original `HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md` for business context, brand strategy decisions, and initial technical insights.

This handover aims to provide a clear path forward. The project is now on a more stable foundation with Tailwind CSS v3, and significant progress has been made in aligning the visual structure with the desired "CleanMe" template.
